# Weather Dashboard

## Goal For This Project
### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
The goal for this project was to make a program that allows you to see current and future weather data on your desired city. Cities you search will be moved to the search history so you can access them easily. If the search history exceeds 10 the oldest item is deleted.

for this project I used the JQuery, Bootstrap, MomentJS, and the OpenWeatherAPI.

No code was provided.
